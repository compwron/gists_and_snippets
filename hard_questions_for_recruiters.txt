If you are able to answer these questions, it would really help me figure out how to think about this opportunity. Thanks for reaching out.

1. What is the team like? Number, composition, specialties? Do they do pull requests or push to master, what are their favorite conferences, is there an on call rotation? :)

2. Would I be the only woman developer on the team?

3. What is your parental leave policy?

4. Does the company offer trans healthcare? How do you stack up against the https://www.hrc.org/hei/hei-scoring-criteria checklist?

5. What is your policy/approach/guidelines on contributing back to open source software projects?
